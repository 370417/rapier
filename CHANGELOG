## v0.2.1
- Fix panic in TriMesh construction and QueryPipeline update caused by a stack overflow or a subtraction underflow.

## v0.2.0
The most significant change on this version is the addition of the `QueryPipeline` responsible for performing
scene-wide queries. So far only ray-casting has been implemented.

- Add `ColliderSet::remove(...)` to remove a collider from the `ColliderSet`.
- Replace `PhysicsPipeline::remove_rigid_body` by `RigidBodySet::remove`.
- The `JointSet.iter()` now returns an iterator yielding `(JointHandle, &Joint)` instead of just `&Joint`.
- Add `ColliderDesc::translation(...)` to set the translation of a collider relative to the rigid-body it is attached to.
- Add `ColliderDesc::rotation(...)` to set the rotation of a collider relative to the rigid-body it is attached to.
- Add `ColliderDesc::position(...)` to set the position of a collider relative to the rigid-body it is attached to.
- Add `Collider::position_wrt_parent()` to get the position of a collider relative to the rigid-body it is attached to.
- Modify `RigidBody::set_position(...)` so it also resets the next kinematic position to the same value.
- Deprecate `Collider::delta()` in favor of the new `Collider::position_wrt_parent()`.
- Fix multiple issues occurring when having colliders resulting in a non-zero center-of-mass.
- Fix a crash happening when removing a rigid-body with a collider, stepping the simulation, adding another rigid-body
 with a collider, and stepping the simulation again.
- Fix NaN when detection contacts between two polygonal faces where one has a normal perfectly perpendicular to the
separating vector.
- Fix bug collision detection between trimeshes and other shapes. The bug appeared depending on whether the trimesh
collider was added before the other shape's collider or after.
